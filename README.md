# home-assistant-supernote-cloud

Home Assistant Custom Component dedicated to the excellent Ratta Supernote products.

This custom component efficiently synchronizes a backup of your notebook to your
local storage and exposes the contents through the media player.

The motivation is to use with [Journal Assistant](https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-journal-assistant) and [Supernote LLM](https://github.com/allenporter/supernote-llm/).

Library for efficient backup based on:
